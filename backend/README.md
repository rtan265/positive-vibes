# [Positive Vibes Only - Backend](https://moodbook-backend.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation:
To run this code on your local machine, first clone the repository. NOTE: This is a subdirectory, so when you clone, you're actually cloning the main folder that consists of the backend and frontend files.  

Open up a commond prompt and do the following:
```
$ cd moodbook && backend
$ node index.js
```

You will need to create a .env file in the same directory as index.js, and include the following:
```
MONGODB_CONNECTION = <YOUR_MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING_HERE>
```

## .env files
