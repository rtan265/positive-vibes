# moodbook
This is an application that has a functional backend and database.
The frontend is deployed on [netlify](https://compassionate-noether-3ad928.netlify.app/) and the backend is deployed on [Heroku](https://moodbook-backend.herokuapp.com/). The database is hosted on [MongoDb Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

# Motivation
At the conclusion of Create Camp 2020, I wanted to further develop my full stack development skills. So I decided to build a project based on a bootcamp that Summer of Tech hosted! I wanted to learn how to deploy to different websites, as well as deploying a working frontend and backend, as well as a database. 

# Plans:
This is still a work in progress. As of (18/08/2020), I have the basic MVP done, but it looks really ugly so I am planning on styling it over the week. I am looking to make this a platform to share positive vibes, to help make lockdown level 3 slightly better.
